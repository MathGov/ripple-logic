# Code of Conduct

RippleLogic is a high-stakes ethics and governance project. Discussion must stay rigorous, respectful, and rights-safe.

## Our standards
We expect participants to:
- Engage in good faith and assume competence.
- Critique ideas, not people.
- Be precise when making claims. If you are uncertain, say so.
- Avoid harassment, threats, hate speech, or discriminatory language.
- Respect privacy and do not publish private information.

## Scope
This applies to all project spaces: issues, pull requests, discussions, and any community channels connected to the repo.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may remove content or restrict participation when behavior violates this code, especially if it:
- endangers others,
- undermines basic safety and respect,
- repeatedly derails technical and ethical review.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness a violation, report it privately to the maintainers (see `SECURITY.md`).

# RippleLogic (MathGov)

If you only read one thing: RippleLogic is a filter-first decision process. It eliminates unsafe options before scoring “best.”

**A safety-first “governance seatbelt” for high-stakes decisions:**  
reject rights violations → bound catastrophic risk → protect system integrity → then optimize welfare.

RippleLogic is a safety-first decision framework for humans and AI systems making consequential choices.  
It works in a strict order:

1. **Reject** any option that violates basic rights.
2. **Rule out** options with unacceptable catastrophic tail risk.
3. **Protect** the structural integrity of the systems that must keep functioning.
4. **Only then rank** remaining options by their net welfare impact.

Stakeholders are modeled as **seven nested unions** (Self through Biosphere).  
Impacts are recorded in a transparent **49-cell matrix** (7 unions × 7 welfare dimensions).

## What RippleLogic is (in plain terms)

RippleLogic prevents “good outcomes” from being used to justify **unacceptable means**.  
It blocks rights-violating or catastrophe-prone options first, and only then compares what remains.

## What RippleLogic claims (and what it does not)

RippleLogic is built for **verification, not belief**. You do not have to trust it. You can inspect how it reached a conclusion.

- **Evaluation scope:** Claims are limited to **Tier 1–3** evaluation.
- **Auditability:** Outputs are designed to be **reconstructible by independent reviewers**.
- **Falsifiability:** Explicit criteria define what evidence would show the framework fails.

No Tier-4 determinism or predictive governance guarantees are claimed.

## Start here (v8.1 canonical release)

- **Release page:** https://github.com/MathGov/ripple-logic/releases/tag/v8.1  
- **Canonical release folder:** `releases/v8.1_2026-02-14/`

That release contains:
- Core specification (RippleLogic v8.1)
- Sentience Gradient Protocol (SGP v4.2.3)
- Agent System specification
- Worked exemplar (Ripple Aligners Tier-2)
- ProofPack skeleton / verification artifacts
- SHA256 integrity file (checksums)

## Integrity verification (quick)

1. Download the release assets (or the full bundle, if provided).
2. Locate the **SHA256 checksums** file in the release artifacts.
3. Compute SHA256 locally and confirm it matches the published checksums.

(If you publish a one-command verification script later, link it here.)

RippleLogic (MathGov)
A safety-first “governance seatbelt” for high-stakes decisions: reject rights violations, bound catastrophic risk, protect system integrity, then optimize welfare.
RippleLogic is a safety-first decision framework for humans and AI systems making consequential choices. It works in a strict order:
1.	Reject any option that violates basic rights.
2.	Rule out options with unacceptable catastrophic tail risk.
3.	Protect the structural integrity of the systems that must keep functioning.
4.	Only then rank the remaining options by their net welfare impact.
Stakeholders are modeled as seven nested unions (Self through Biosphere), and impacts are recorded in a transparent 49-cell matrix (7 unions × 7 welfare dimensions).
RippleLogic is built for verification, not belief.
You do not have to trust it. You can inspect how it reached its conclusion.
•	Claims are limited to Tier 1–3 evaluation.
•	Outputs are reconstructible by independent reviewers.
•	Explicit falsification criteria define what evidence would show the framework fails.
The canonical v8.1 specification and companion artifacts are published for open review and pilot testing at https://ripplelogic.org.

What RippleLogic Claims (and What It Does Not)
It Claims
•	Rights floors should not be traded for aggregate benefit.
•	Catastrophic tail risks must be bounded before welfare optimization.
•	Governance decisions should be auditable and reconstructible.
•	Ethical reasoning can be structured without pretending to eliminate moral disagreement.
It Does Not Claim
•	To replace human judgment.
•	To produce perfect answers.
•	To solve moral philosophy.
•	To operate beyond Tier 1–3 evaluation.
•	To guarantee safety in all contexts.
RippleLogic is a decision discipline, not an oracle.

Design Principles
•	Non-compensable rights floors
•	Tail-risk bounding before optimization
•	System integrity protection
•	Transparent welfare accounting
•	Audit artifacts and integrity checks
•	Explicit falsification criteria

Why This Exists
High-stakes systems increasingly affect entire populations and ecosystems.
Optimizing outcomes without protecting rights and bounding catastrophic risk is unstable.
RippleLogic exists to impose structure on that instability.

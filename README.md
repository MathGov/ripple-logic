# RippleLogic (MathGov)

**A safety-first “governance seatbelt” for high-stakes decisions: reject rights violations, bound catastrophic risk, protect system integrity, then optimize welfare.**

RippleLogic is a safety-first decision framework for humans and AI systems making consequential choices. It works in a strict order:

1. Reject any option that violates basic rights.  
2. Rule out options with unacceptable catastrophic tail risk.  
3. Protect the structural integrity of the systems that must keep functioning.  
4. Only then rank the remaining options by their net welfare impact.

Stakeholders are modeled as seven nested unions (Self through Biosphere), and impacts are recorded in a transparent 49-cell matrix (7 unions × 7 welfare dimensions).

RippleLogic is built for verification, not belief. You do not have to trust it. You can inspect how it reached its conclusion.

- Claims are limited to Tier 1–3 evaluation.  
- Outputs are reconstructible by independent reviewers.  
- Explicit falsification criteria define what evidence would show the framework fails.  

The canonical v8.1 specification and companion artifacts are published for open review and pilot testing at https://ripplelogic.org.

## In One Sentence

RippleLogic prevents rights violations and catastrophic decisions before optimizing outcomes.

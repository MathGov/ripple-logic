**Latest stable release:** v8.5.3  
Release page: https://github.com/MathGov/ripple-logic/releases/tag/v8.5.3

## If you only read one thing

RippleLogic is a filter-first decision system.  
It eliminates unsafe options before scoring what is “best.”

It is a safety-first governance architecture for high-stakes human and AI decisions.

Order of operation:

1. Reject rights violations (Non-Compensatory Rights Constraint, NCRC).
2. Bound unacceptable catastrophic tail risk.
3. Protect structural system integrity.
4. Only then optimize welfare across stakeholders.

Unsafe options are removed before optimization begins.

## What RippleLogic Is

RippleLogic is a rights-first, union-based ethical operating system for consequential decision-making.

It is designed for:

- AI alignment environments
- Policy and governance decisions
- Multi-stakeholder tradeoff analysis
- High-risk infrastructure systems

Stakeholders are modeled as seven nested unions:

Self → Household → Community → Organization → Polity → Humanity → Biosphere

Impacts are recorded in a transparent 49-cell evaluation matrix  
(7 unions × 7 welfare dimensions).

The system is explicitly auditable, falsifiable, and reconstruction-ready.

## What RippleLogic Does Not Claim

RippleLogic does not claim:

- Deterministic governance guarantees
- Predictive omniscience
- Tier-4 full automation authority
- Replacement of human moral agency

Evaluation claims are limited to Tier 1–3 structured evaluation.

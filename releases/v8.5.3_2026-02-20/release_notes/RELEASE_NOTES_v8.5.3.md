# RippleLogic v8.5.3 Release Bundle (CANON)

This bundle contains the pinned **v8.5.3 publish set**:

## Canonical documents (DOCX + PDF)
- Ripple_Logic v8.5.3 (Foundation Paper)
- SGP v4.2.3 (Sentience Gradient Protocol)
- RippleLogic Agent System v8.5.3 (Complete Specification)

## Tier-2 worked-run tool
- Ripple Aligners Sheet v1.8.3 (pinned to RL v8.5.3 + SGP v4.2.3)

## Companion packs (hash-bound)
These are included because the Agent System document’s completion statement declares them as part of the release:
- `companion/OperatorAuth_Pack_v8.5.3/`  
  JSON Schemas + example vectors + VERIFY.md + manifest.json
- `companion/Stewardship_Profiles_v8.5.3/`  
  Reference profiles + schema + manifest.json

## Claimability note
- Tier 1–3 claims are supported by the Foundation Paper and the evidence artifacts required by the Tier contract / conformance checklists.
- Tier 4 remains a design target and **claims are prohibited** until a public ProofPack is independently replayable.

## Integrity
All files are hash-bound via `manifest/release_manifest_v8.5.3.json` and `manifest/SHA256SUMS.txt`.
See `manifest/VERIFY.md` for a two-step human verification procedure.

/mnt/data/RippleLogic_ProofPack_Lite_v8.5.3_beta.1/tools/validate_proofpack.py:10: DeprecationWarning: jsonschema.RefResolver is deprecated as of v4.18.0, in favor of the https://github.com/python-jsonschema/referencing library, which provides more compliant referencing behavior as well as more flexible APIs for customization. A future release will remove RefResolver. Please file a feature request (on referencing) if you are missing an API for the kind of customization you need.
